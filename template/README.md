Front-end for your Sanity project, built with [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev).

## Developing

Start by installing dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`). Then, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Your site should already be connected to [Netlify](https://netlify.com). If you want, you can install any [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. To execute builds locally, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
