# SvelteKit / Sanity.io starter

- [ ] Starter logic & testing
- [ ] Documentation & cleaning unnecessary code
  - How much to explain in files?
- [ ] (?) Real-time previews for posts
  - We should probably have a `@sanity/svelte-kit` or something similar to `next-sanity`, in which point we could implement this?
- [ ] (?) Better images - worried about complexity, but would like at least some padding to prevent content from jumping
  - We could leave as is and have `@sanity/svelte-image` be the permanent solve
- [ ] (?) 404 & settings documents?
- [ ] Clean console errors
- [ ]
